 Smarter Approaches for Deciding Additional NLP Agents
Instead of keyword-based detection, we can use machine learning, NLP models, or rule-based heuristics to intelligently determine whether additional agents should be consulted.

‚úÖ Smarter Approaches
1Ô∏è‚É£ Named Entity Recognition (NER) - Extract Medical Terms
üîπ Use spaCy's NER or Med7 (a medical NER model) to extract symptoms, conditions, and medication-related terms.
üîπ Based on recognized entities, decide which NLP agents should process the request.

# Load a medical NER model (spaCy's en_core_sci_sm or Med7)
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_sci_sm")  # Example with SciSpacy

def extract_medical_entities(text):
    """Extract symptoms, conditions, and medical entities from text."""
    doc = nlp(text)
    entities = {ent.label_: ent.text for ent in doc.ents}
    return entities


Example

text = "Patient complains of severe anxiety, chronic fatigue, and poor nutrition."
print(extract_medical_entities(text))
‚úÖ Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "SYMPTOM": "severe anxiety",
    "SYMPTOM": "chronic fatigue",
    "DIET": "poor nutrition"
}
üí° Decision:

If "SYMPTOM": "severe anxiety" ‚Üí Call nlp_mental
If "DIET": "poor nutrition" ‚Üí Call nlp_nutrition


2Ô∏è‚É£ Text Classification Model - Predict Consultation Type
üîπ Train a text classification model (e.g., scikit-learn, transformers, or spaCy) to predict which NLP agents should be consulted.

Example Using a Pre-Trained Transformer

from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")

def predict_specialists(text):
    """Classify medical text into relevant categories."""
    labels = ["general_medicine", "mental_health", "nutrition"]
    result = classifier(text, labels)
    return [labels[i] for i, score in enumerate(result["scores"]) if score > 0.6]  # Only keep high-confidence results


Example

text = "Patient is experiencing extreme stress, poor diet, and has a history of heart disease."
print(predict_specialists(text))
‚úÖ Output:

json
Copy
Edit
["mental_health", "nutrition"]
üí° Decision:

Send to nlp_mental
Send to nlp_nutrition
If "history of heart disease" is detected ‚Üí Request Medical History


3Ô∏è‚É£ Rule-Based Decision Tree (Hybrid Approach)
üîπ Use rules + machine learning for more explainable decision-making.

Example Decision Tree

def decide_nlp_agents(text, metadata):
    """Determine which NLP agents should be consulted using rules & AI."""
    agents = set()

    # 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use metadata to determine the primary NLP agent
    if metadata.get("consultation_type") in OrchestratorConfig.NLP_AGENT_QUEUES:
        agents.add(OrchestratorConfig.NLP_AGENT_QUEUES[metadata["consultation_type"]])

    # 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use NER to detect symptoms and conditions
    entities = extract_medical_entities(text)
    if "SYMPTOM" in entities and "anxiety" in entities["SYMPTOM"]:
        agents.add(OrchestratorConfig.NLP_AGENT_QUEUES["mental_health"])
    if "DIET" in entities:
        agents.add(OrchestratorConfig.NLP_AGENT_QUEUES["nutrition"])

    # 3Ô∏è‚É£ Use a classification model to predict additional specialists
    predicted_agents = predict_specialists(text)
    for agent in predicted_agents:
        if agent in OrchestratorConfig.NLP_AGENT_QUEUES:
            agents.add(OrchestratorConfig.NLP_AGENT_QUEUES[agent])

    return agents


Example

text = "Patient is experiencing anxiety and loss of appetite."
metadata = {"patient_id": "12345", "consultation_type": "general_medicine"}
print(decide_nlp_agents(text, metadata))
‚úÖ Output:


["nlp_general", "nlp_mental", "nlp_nutrition"]


üî• Which Approach Is Best?
Approach	Pros	Cons
Keyword Matching (Current)	Simple, fast	Limited accuracy
NER (spaCy, Med7)	More precise than keywords, interpretable	Needs a medical NER model
Text Classification (Transformers)	More flexible, generalizes well	Needs labeled training data
Hybrid (Rules + AI)	Balances interpretability & ML	More complex implementation
üîπ Recommended: Start with NER + Rules, then integrate a text classifier for better accuracy.
